# Clarearte â€” React + TypeScript

> Dev setup & tooling. Product/SEO/i18n goals live in **PRD.md**.

## Stack (current)
- React + TypeScript + Vite (HMR)
- ESLint + (optional) type-aware rules
- Tailwind (planned)
- shadcn/ui (planned)
- NOTE: For SEO (SSG/ISR/SSR), we **plan to migrate to Next.js (App Router)**. Keep this Vite template until the framework decision is finalized.

## Scripts
```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm preview
pnpm lint
